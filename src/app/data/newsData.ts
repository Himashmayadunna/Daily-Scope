      <div class="article-content">
        <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced sweeping new tariffs that will take effect against dozens of countries, marking a significant escalation in trade tensions globally. The announcement came just hours before the deadline for negotiating alternative deals.</p>
        
        <p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump stated that "billions of dollars are now flowing into the US Treasury due to these strategic tariffs," defending the policy as beneficial for American workers and businesses.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Details of the Tariff Policy</h3>
        <p>The new tariffs will affect imports from over 40 countries, with rates ranging from 15% to 35% depending on the product category and country of origin. Industries most affected include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Electronics and semiconductors:</strong> 25% tariff on chips and electronic components</li>
          <li><strong>Automotive parts and vehicles:</strong> 30% on imported cars and parts</li>
          <li><strong>Steel and aluminum products:</strong> 35% on raw materials</li>
          <li><strong>Textiles and clothing:</strong> 20% on imported garments</li>
          <li><strong>Agricultural machinery:</strong> 15% on farming equipment</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Economic Impact Analysis</h3>
        <p>Economic experts are divided on the potential impact of these tariffs. Supporters argue they will protect American jobs and reduce the trade deficit, while critics warn of increased consumer prices and potential retaliation from affected countries.</p>
        
        <p>"These tariffs represent the most significant trade policy shift in decades," said Dr. Sarah Mitchell, an international trade economist at Georgetown University. "While they may provide short-term protection for some domestic industries, the long-term consequences could be far-reaching."</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The immediate effect will be higher prices for consumers on imported goods. We estimate a typical American family could see their annual expenses increase by $1,200-$1,800 due to these tariffs."</p>
          <cite>- Economic Policy Institute</cite>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>International Response</h3>
        <p>Several countries have already announced their intention to file complaints with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and are considering retaliatory measures:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>European Union:</strong> Planning counter-tariffs on $50 billion worth of American exports</li>
          <li><strong>China:</strong> Considering restrictions on rare earth mineral exports</li>
          <li><strong>Canada:</strong> Reviewing trade agreements and potential diplomatic responses</li>
          <li><strong>Mexico:</strong> Threatening to impose tariffs on US agricultural products</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Business Community Reactions</h3>
        <p>The business community has shown mixed reactions to the tariff announcements:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Supporters include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>US Steel Corporation - expects increased domestic demand</li>
          <li>American Aluminum Association - projects 15,000 new jobs</li>
          <li>Textile manufacturers - anticipating production increases</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Critics include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Technology companies - warning of supply chain disruptions</li>
          <li>Retail associations - concerned about consumer price increases</li>
          <li>Automotive manufacturers - facing higher production costs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Timeline and Implementation</h3>
        <p>The tariffs will be implemented in phases over the next six months:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Phase 1 (Immediate):</strong> Steel, aluminum, and raw materials</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 2 (30 days):</strong> Electronics and automotive components</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 3 (90 days):</strong> Consumer goods and textiles</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 4 (180 days):</strong> Agricultural products and machinery</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The administration has indicated that countries willing to negotiate new trade agreements may receive exemptions or reduced tariff rates. However, specific criteria for such negotiations have not been disclosed.</p>
        
        <p>As global markets continue to react to these developments, economists predict significant volatility in international trade patterns over the coming months. The full economic impact of these policies will likely become clearer as businesses and consumers adjust to the new trade landscape.</p>

      <div class="article-content">
        <p>President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has clarified that no formal agreement has been finalized or signed to reduce the reciprocal tariff imposed by the United States on Sri Lankan exports to 20%, dispelling rumors about a breakthrough in trade negotiations.</p>
        
        <p>Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, the President emphasized that while discussions are ongoing, reports of a concluded deal are premature and inaccurate.</p>
        
        <h3>Current Tariff Situation</h3>
        <p>The United States currently imposes varying tariffs on Sri Lankan exports, with some products facing rates as high as 25-30%. The proposed reduction to 20% would provide significant relief to Sri Lankan exporters, particularly in key industries.</p>
        
        <p>"We are committed to securing the best possible terms for our exporters, but we will not rush into agreements that may not serve our long-term interests," President Dissanayake stated during the press briefing.</p>
        
        <h3>Impact on Key Export Industries</h3>
        <p>Sri Lanka's export economy heavily relies on several key sectors that would benefit significantly from reduced tariffs:</p>

        </ul>
